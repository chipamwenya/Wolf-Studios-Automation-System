## Current Challenges

Currently, Wolf Studios manages projects and inquiries through phone calls and email. While this works with only a couple of major clients, the process can become unstructured and inefficient as the business grows. Key pain points include:

- **Disorganized Inquiries:**  
  Inquiries are received directly via phone and email, making it challenging to track and manage them in a centralized manner.

- **Unstructured Project Details:**  
  Clients typically share details such as dates, times, locations, and deliverables (e.g., point-to-camera interviews, photographs, b-roll, consent forms) in an ad-hoc way.

- **Inefficient Accounting & Financial Tracking:**  
  Existing tools like Intuit QuickBooks have proven too complex and unfriendly, leaving a need for a system that:
  - Stores pricing for specific services
  - Generates automated invoices and quotations
  - Tracks income and expenses
  - Calculates net monthly profit
  - Facilitates timely tax payments

## Proposed Workflow & Automation Solutions

### 1. Client Management

- **Digital Submission Form:**  
  Develop a submission form (using Tally Forms or a similar tool) where clients can submit:
  - Their contact information (including WhatsApp number)
  - Project details (dates, times, location, deliverables)
  - Additional notes or special requests

- **Centralized CRM:**  
  Automatically capture all form submissions into a Google Sheets-based CRM, ensuring every inquiry is organized in one place.

- **Automated Follow-Up:**  
  Utilize an automation platform (e.g., Make.com) to trigger follow-up notifications via WhatsApp or email after a form submission.

### 2. Accounting & Financial Tracking

- **Automated Invoicing & Quotations:**  
  Create workflows that generate invoices and quotations based on predefined service pricing data.

- **Expense & Income Tracking:**  
  Integrate an accounting system that records all financial data, calculates net profit each month, and monitors expenses against budget.

- **Tax Management:**  
  Implement automated reminders and reporting to help ensure taxes are paid on time.

  Automated document generation (invoices, quotations, contracts) establishes a consistent, professional approach for Wolf Studios.

- **Efficient Financial Oversight:**  
  Integrated income, expense, and tax tracking allows for better monitoring of financial performance and informed decision-making.

- **Scalability:**  
  As Wolf Studios grows, the system can easily handle increased inquiry volumes and financial data, supporting long-term business expansion.
